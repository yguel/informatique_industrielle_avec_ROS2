## Overview

The [ros2_control](https://control.ros.org) framework is a real-time control framework designed for general robotics applications that is gaining increasing attention in both research and industrial contexts. This tutorial is designed to help you understand the basic concepts of controlling a robot using ros2_control and EtherCAT.

## What You'll Learn

This workshop covers the following topics:

[Get Started :material-arrow-right:](getting-started/installation.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## The SCARA Robot

Throughout this tutorial, we'll work with a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) manipulator. This robot type is commonly used in industrial applications for pick-and-place operations, assembly tasks, and more.

### Robot Structure

The SCARA robot consists of:

- **3 Degrees of Freedom**: Two revolute joints for horizontal movement and one prismatic joint for vertical movement
- **Joint 1 & 2**: Revolute joints controlling the arm position in the XY plane
- **Joint 3**: Prismatic joint controlling the vertical (Z-axis) position

## ros2_control Framework

Before diving into the tutorials, it's helpful to understand the ros2_control framework architecture:

- **Controller Manager**: Orchestrates the control loop and manages controller lifecycle
- **Hardware Interface**: Abstracts physical hardware or simulation
- **Controllers**: Implement control algorithms for your robot
- **Resource Manager**: Manages hardware resources and interfaces

For a detailed overview, see the [ros2_control Overview](tutorials/r2c_overview.md).
